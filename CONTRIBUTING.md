# Contributing to Marketspace API

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Marketspace API! It's people like you that make Marketspace API such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make sure to open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/yourusername/marketspace/issues) if one doesn't already exist. If it does, please add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork Marketspace API](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-contribution-guidelines
```

## Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first.

## Get the style right

Your code will need to adhere to the same coding conventions used throughout the project.

## Make a Pull Request

Once your branch is looking good, you can [make a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request).

As soon as possible I will review your pull request and if there are any changes to be made, I will give feedback and guidance on how to make them.

## What happens next?

If everything goes well, your PR will be merged in! If your changes are not up to scratch, we'll let you know what needs to be done.

Happy contributing!ðŸŽ‰
